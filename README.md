# Analyzing Factors of Airbnb Pricing in San Diego
By: Tyson Tran and Benson Duong

## Research Question: What spatial and non-spatial factors are most likely to influence the listings price of an Airbnb?

### Takeaways
 - The biggest factors affecting pricing are location and size of the Airbnb home
 - Closeness to bigger tourist attractions do have an effect on the Airbnb pricing
 - Higher ratings of an Airbnb property do not correlate with higher pricing
 
### Conclusion and Future work
It is difficult to completely answer the research question because it is more open-ended and there are many factors that can contribute to the price of Airbnb listings and it would be difficult to understand every single factor. With our project, we looked at the factors that are most likely to be the biggest contributor to the Airbnb listing price and we found that the biggest contributors are related to location, size, and previous experiences with the property. I think an additional analysis step that we can do is to look at the relationship between property expenses for investors versus the listing price of an Airbnb to understand if people are being fairly charged to stay at a property or if there are other factors beyond the expenses that investors incur that gauge the price of the Airbnb listing.
